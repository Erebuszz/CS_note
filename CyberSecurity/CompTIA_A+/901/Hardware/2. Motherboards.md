## Motherboards

### Form Factors

1. ATX - Advanced Tech Extend

* Memories are usually close to the CPU for the faster information communication

-  <b>Jumpers</b> 
	> Several pins on the motherboard, we can put jumper blocks on them and connect in order to make additional configuration

## Expansion Slots

1. PCI

* Legacy expansion slots - Speeds from 133 MB/s to 533 MB/s

2. PCI-X

* Designed for servers (this is not PCI Express)
* 1,064 MB/s throughput

3. PCI-E

* Serial communication - xl, x2, x4, x8, xl6, x32 lanes
* High performance for devices like high-end graphics adapters
* PCI Express throughput per-lane in each direction
* Speeds from 250 MB/s to 2 GB/s

4. Mini-PCI

* PCI and PCI Express for laptops
* Adapter cards are internal to the device

5. AGP
6. CNR
