# BIOS - Basic Input / Output System

* The software used to start your computer
	* The firmware
	* System BIOS, ROM BIOS
	* ROM or flash memory
* Initialize CPU and memory
	* Build the workplace
* POST
	* Power-On Self-Test
* Look for a boot loader
	* Start the operating system

# Category

## Legacy BIOS

* The original / traditional BIOS
* Older operating systems talked to hardware through the BIOS
	* Instead of accessing hardware directly
* Limited hardware support
	* No drivers for modern network, video, and storage devices

## UEFI BIOS

* Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
	* Based on Intel's EFI<br>
	(Extensible Firmware Interface)
* A defined standard
	* Implemented by the manufaturers
* Designed to replace the legacy BIOS

### Advantage

* Boot from large (> 2.2 TB)<br>
GUID partition table (GPT) disks
	* Also supports FAT and removable media
* Includes a pre-boot environment
	* This isn't an operating system
	* Has its own shell, drives, and applications
	* Browse the internet, backup a storage drive
	* Remote diagnostics, even without an OS

# Component Information

## Nonvolatile BIOS memory

* Store the BIOS configuration
* Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
	* A type of memory
	* May be backed up with a battery
* Usually flash memory these days
	* Fastly stored and accessed


## The "CMOS" battery

> A round, silver-like things near the BIOS chip on the motherboard

<img src="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/cmos.jpg" width="150">

* Not needed for today's flash-based storage
	* Maintain older BIOS configurations
	* May only be used to maintain date / time
* A bad battery will require a BIOS configuration on every boot
* On older systems, can reset the BIOS configuations by removing the battery

## Information we’ll get from BIOS :

+ RAM
+ Hard drive
+ Optical Drive(CD drive…)
+ CPU(central processing unit)

# Prepare to install

## 1. Determine BIOS Version

There are two commands for checking the BIOS version on Windows

	> msinfo32
	> dxdiag

## 2. Find Update

Download the current and new versions

## 3. Secure Power

> On desktop computers or servers, 
> we use <b>UPS</b> (Uninterruptible Battery Supply)
> as a second source of electricity

## 4. Install BIOS

# Configurations

## The secret button(s)

* Launching the system setup
	* Del, F1, F2, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Alt-S

Can also configured in virtual environment, such as
* Microsoft Virtual PC (Windows 7) or Hyper-V (Windows 8)
* VMware Workstation Player
* But not Virtaulbox

## Use BIOS to change the boot order

1. Hard drive
2. CD
3. USB
4. PXE (network booting from server)

## Enable and disable devices

- I/O devices
- WOC (remotely turn on the computer)
- date / time
- CPU clock speeds
- Virtualization (enabled to use multiple OS)

## RAM

* View and configure memory settings

## CPU types

# Diagnostics

## POST (Power On Self Test)

A set of instructions to test our compurter components<br>
 in an sequential order when we boot our computer 

1. CPU & POST BIOS ROM
2. system timer
3. video card
4. memory
5. keyboard
6. disk drives

> If one step goes wrong, it will completely stop and won’t pass it

* if we’ve got problems with POST, you can first check beeps on the motherboard, the beep code’s meaning depends on the manufacturer, it may show you the problems and status of Windows and BIOS processes. Or, we can use POST card plugged onto one of the PCI slots and turn on the computer, it will show what’s going on.

# Security

## BIOS passwords

- BIOS / User password
	- System won't start
	- Need the password to start your OS
- Supervisor password
	- Restrict BIOS changes
	- Must use the password to change any BIOS configurations

## Full disk encryption

- Everything is encrypted
	- Not just individual files
- Windows bitlocker disk encryption
	- BIOS integrates with TPM
- TPM - Trusted Platform Module
	- Can be added to many motherboards
	- Built-in to some systems
	- Add advances cryptographic functions

## LoJack for Laptops

- Originally called CompuTrace
- Built	into the BIOS
	- Software installed into the OS
	- Reinstalls itself if removed or new storage drive installed
- "Phone home" function
	- Provides location information
- Theft mode
	- Remotely lock the laptop and / or delete files
	- Forces a startup password

## Secure boot

- Malicious software can "own" your computer
	- Malicious drivers or OS software
- Secure boot
	- Part of the UEFI specification
- Digitally sign known-good software
	- Cryptographic secure
	- Software won't run without the proper signature
- Support in many different OS
