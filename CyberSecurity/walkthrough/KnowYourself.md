# Protect What You Value

* What is most confidetial to me?
* What can't you afford to lose?
* What is irreplacable?
* What would cause the most damage?
* What might impact your reputation?

# What is Privacy, Anonymity and Pseudonymity?

## Privacy

> Nobody seeing what you do, but potentially knowing who you are

* About content
* Maintaining confidentiality, keeping secrets

## Anonymity

> Nobody knowing who you are, but potentially seeing what you do

* Concerns your identiry
* Keeping your actions and activities separate from your true identity
* To be nameless, to be faceless

## Pseudonymity

> When you wish to retain a reputation against an identity

*e.g. Having an alias for social media or an online grouop*

* An alias
* A cover 
* A false identity

These will determine the security that you require

# Security, Vulnerabilities, Threats and Adversaries

- Red triangles represent bugs, vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your secutity controls

We select the security control based on the type of threats and the adversaries that we face

<b>Risk = (Vulnerabilities x Threats x Consequences)</b>

+ Security is a technology
+ Security is an action
+ Security is a process

# Threat Modeling and Risk Assessments

You can not ever have 100% security

Choose a balance between **Usability** and **Security**

Take a **risk-based approach** to apply right level of security

## Risk Assessments Process

(How to select your security control)

Find out:
1. Assets
    - What you value
2. Vulnerabilities
3. Threats
4. Adversaries
5. Consequences

Focus on the __Consequences__ if the threats and adversaries are less tangible to discover

(Once you finished your assessment)

1. Select
    - (your security control)
2. Implement
3. Assess
    - (the effectiveness)
4. Monitor

If a weakness was discovered, go back to step one and reselect a security control

# Security vs Privacy vs Anonymity - Can we have it all?

Security is sometimes contradiction to Privacy and Anonymity

-  The amount of privacy and anonymity that you require is directly proportional to the security that you need

# Defense in Depth

Provide layers of defense, so when defense fails, another continue to protect you in its place

# The Zero Trust Model

The less you trust, the lower your risk

Minimize the number of things that you trust, including yourself

Evaluate instead of trusting
